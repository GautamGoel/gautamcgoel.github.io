<p>I am a PhD student in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) department at Caltech, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Babak Hassibi. I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, and the analysis of algorithms, especially 1) online learning and online decision making; 2) integrating machine learning with dynamics and control; 3) non-convex optimization, and 4) randomized algorithms. Much of my PhD work has been supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and an Amazon AWS AI Fellowship. </p>
<p> I enjoy travelling, and have visited the following countries for conferences during my PhD: Australia (CDC 2017), Sweden (COLT 2018), Japan (AISTATS 2019), and Canada (NeurIPS 2019). </p>

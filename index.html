            <dd> I am a PhD student in the Computing and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) department at Caltech, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Babak Hassibi. I am broadly interested in machine learning, optimization, signal processing, and control, especially 1) online optimization and sequential decision-making under uncertainty, and 2) integrating ideas from machine learning with signal processing and control. Much of my PhD work has been supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and an Amazon AI4Science Fellowship. In 2021 I was named a Rising Star in Data Science by the University of Chicago Center for Data and Computing.

			We survey recent work on the communication complexity of functions $F : \{0, 1\}^n \times \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ 
			of the form $f (x \circ y)$ where $f : \{0, 1\}^n â†’ \{0, 1\}$ is a total boolean function and $\circ$ represents either bit-wise XOR 			or bit-wise AND. This naturally leads to the study of models of computation that are, in a sense, 'between' communication complexity 			and decision tree complexity. These classes of functions capture a rich class of communication problems while simultaneously being 			amenable to analysis with minimal assumptions about the structure of $f$. This flexibility has shed new light on central topics in 			communication complexity, including restricted cases of the log-rank conjecture and the query-to-communication lifting methodology.

		Let $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ be a boolean function, and let
		$f_\land (x, y) = f(x \land y)$ denote the AND-function
		of $f$,
		where $x \land y$ denotes bit-wise AND. 
		We study the deterministic communication complexity 
		of $f_\land$ and show that, up to a $\log n$ factor, 
		it is bounded by a polynomial in the logarithm 
		of the real rank of the communication matrix of $f_\land$. 
		This comes within a $\log n$ factor of 
		establishing the log-rank conjecturefor AND-functions with no assumptions on $f$. 
		Our result stands in contrast with previous results on special cases of the log-rank 
		conjecture, which needed significant restrictions on $f$ such as monotonicity or 
		low $\mathbb{F}_2$-degree. 
		Our techniques can also be used to prove (within a $\log n$ factor) a 
		lifting theorem for AND-functions, stating that the deterministic communication 
		complexity of $f_\land$ is polynomially-related to the AND-decision tree complexity of
		$f$.
		<br><br>
		The results rely on a new structural result regarding boolean functions 
		$f:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$
		with a sparse polynomial representation, which may be of independent interest.  
		We show that if the polynomial computing $f$ has few monomials then the set system 
		of the monomials has a small hitting set, of size poly-logarithmic in its sparsity.  
		We also establish extensions of this result to multi-linear polynomials 
		$f:\{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ 
		with a larger range.

		Computational pseudorandomness studies the extent to which a random variable 
		$\mathbf{Z}$ looks like the uniform distribution according to a class of 
		tests $\mathcal{F}$. Computational <i> entropy </i> generalizes computational 
		pseudorandomness by studying the extent which a random variable looks like a 
		high entropy distribution. There are different formal definitions of computational 
		entropy with different advantages for different applications. Because of this, 
		it is of interest to understand when these definitions are equivalent.
		<br><br>	
		We consider three notions of computational entropy which are known to be equivalent when 
		the test class $\mathcal{F}$ is closed under taking majorities. 
		This equivalence constitutes (essentially) the so-called dense model 
		theorem of Green and Tao (and later made explicit by Tao-Zeigler, Reingold et al., 
		and Gowers). The dense model theorem plays a key role in Green and Tao's proof 
		that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions and 
		has since been connected to a surprisingly wide range of topics in 
		mathematics and computer science, including cryptography, computational 
		complexity, combinatorics and machine learning. We show that, 
		in different situations where $\mathcal{F}$ is <i> not </i> closed under majority, 
		this equivalence fails. 
		This in turn provides the first examples to appear in the literature 
		in which the dense model theorem is false.

                     Dynamic descriptive complexity seeks to characterize the complexity of queries in terms of the logical language required to express update programs that maintain them. It is a natural notion in the study of relational databases: the database is subject to change and the total re-computation of a query may not be feasible due to both the rate of change, the static complexity of the query, or simply the size of the database in question. 
                     <br><br>
                     Here, we present a $\text{Dyn-QF}$ algorithm for model-checking $\text{FO}$ properties on bounded-degree structures. The main technical tool is an algorithm for maintaining the neighborhoods of elements in bounded-degree structures, which can be then be applied to perform model checking on particular logics admitting local normal forms. As applications of the methodology, we show algorithms for maintaining the number of witnesses to a first-order property and model checking the counting logic $\text{FOCN}(\textbf{P})$ recently introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt. This in turn establishes $\text{Dyn-QF}$ algorithms for simulating $\text{FO}(COUNT)$ properties on bounded-degree structures, making partial progress towards the conjecture that $\text{FO}(COUNT) \subseteq \text{Dyn-FO}$, originally made by Patnaik and Immerman in the '90s.

                     ...In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a
                     single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety
                     of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the
                     Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and
                     which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so
                     fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map
                     was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the
                     Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are
                     Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is
                     no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.

Building a workstation is a rite of passage undertaken by almost all coders at some point or another. Many grad students in my department have also started building their own custom systems with beefy GPUs now that GPU computing has become the *de facto* platform for serious machine learning work; both my officemates built their own systems, for example. While building a computer from components can be a lot of fun, it can also be a daunting task for first-timers. In this post I'll outline the main steps, from selecting components to assembly to troubleshooting.


## Selecting components
The necessary components to construct a workstation are a CPU, a motherboard, 1-4 sticks of RAM, a solid-state drive (SSD), a case, and a power supply. Additionally, you may want to consider investing in a graphics processing unit (GPU) if you intend to do heavy graphical work (video editing, animation, etc) or high performance computing/scientific computing (machine learning, physics simulations, etc). In particular, GPUs have now become a standard tool for powering training and inference in deep learning models. Note that if your CPU does not have integrated graphics you will need a GPU just to get any video output. Almost all Intel Core processors have integrated graphics, but Intel Xeon processors and most AMD processors do not feature integrated graphics.
